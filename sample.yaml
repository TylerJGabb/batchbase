# sample yaml
batch_name:
  # yaml to use for this batch
  yaml: "path/to/some/yaml/file"
  input_dir: "path/with/regex/to/some/dir*matching_file_names*.phot"
  # you can use regex, like in the input_dir example, you could do some sort of pattern matching for files
  # variables that can be used include
    # NUMB - number of this run in the batch, start at 0
    # NUMT - number of this run in total, start at 0
    # NUMR - number of times this file has been run, if this first time then 0
    # FILE - name of original photFile
    # STAMP - timestamp of run in format START:COMPLETE
  # where to output to:
  output_dir: "path/with/regex/to/some/dir*NUMB:FILE/FILE_NUMR"
  # then fill in any missing settings, stuff left blank in the example yaml because it's file specific
  additional_settings:
    # for example,
    main_sequence.msRgbModel: "NUMR"
  # so then if you run this batch 5 times, it will try a different sampling
  # method each time.
  # how to handle different exit codes:
  codes:
    first:
      exit: 0
      # some settings on what to do if you get exit code 0
    second:
      exit: 1
      # etc
      # maybe some sort of logging settings?
      # or some sort of rerun settings

# define multiple such batches
# then run the code from command line like this:
  # batchbase [path to this yaml] [batches:[0:43,48:90,1000,1000000:2000000]]
  # leave the batches option blank to just run all the batches in the yaml
