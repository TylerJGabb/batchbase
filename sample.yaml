# sample yaml
batch_name:
  number: 0
  # yaml to use for this batch
  yaml: "path/to/some/yaml/file"
  input_dir: "path/with/regex/to/some/dir*matching_file_names*.phot"
  # how to fill in any missing settings:
  # variables that can be used include
    # NUMB - number of this run in the batch, start at 0
    # NUMT - number of this run in total, start at 0
    # NUMR - number of times this file has been run, if this first time then 0
    # FILE - name of original photFile
  # also you can use regex 
  # for example,
  main_sequence.msRgbModel: "NUMR"
  # so then if you run this batch 5 times, it will try a different sampling
  # method each time
  codes:
    first:
      exit: 0
      # some settings on what to do if you get exit code 0
    second:
      exit: 1
      # etc

# define multiple such batches
# then run the code from command line like this:
  # batchbase [path to this yaml] [batches:[0:43,48:90,1000,1000000:2000000]]
  # leave the batches option blank to just run all the batches in the yaml
